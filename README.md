## General Information

This is my solution to the *Codecademy* project titled 'Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts', wherein we were given
the template for an artistic webpage and had to implement the design specification.  The design is quite basic
and could be improved by *float*ing the image descriptions to the right of the images, or by using an *HTML `<table>`* 
element to force a two-column design.  However, I have left the design as it is because it fulfills the design 
specification requirements.

## Technologies

This project required the use of **HTML** and **CSS**.  Additionally, I have taken the opportunity to practise my 
**Markdown** language skills in creating this README.md file, and have also uploaded the project remotely in order to brush 
up my Git/GitHub skills.

## Setup

As this is a simple project, the setup required is very simple.  Clone this project to the directory of your choice 
on your local machine, then double-click the **index.html** file.
